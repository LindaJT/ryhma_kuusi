### Getting the program to run

You can download the newest version of the application from the [releases-page](https://github.com/LindaJT/ryhma_kuusi/releases).

The program is a jar-file. You can run such a file using Java, which itself supports multiple operating systems, such as Windows and Mac OSX among various Linux- and BSD -based systems. Make sure that you have a sensibly modern version of Java installed on your system.

Run the program using your system's command line (for example, in Windows it would be 'cmd.exe'). On the command line, navigate to the folder where you downloaded the jar-file and run the command `java -jar BookmarkApp_01.jar` (where the last part is the file's name -- change it if needed).

### Using the application

In these early stages of development, using the application should be quite self-explanatory. The application will guide you in adding books and listing them. The application doesn't (yet) have an in-built manual, other than the prompts is gives while running.
